His father was a machinist and his mother was an accountant, and so it’s not a very big surprise that at the age of 12, Steve picked up the phone and called Mr. Hewlett from Hewlett-Packard to request the parts he needed to build a frequency counter, not only was he given the parts, but the following summer he worked at putting nuts and bolts together on frequency counters at Hewlett-Packard.</p>'

He developed a love of Calligraphy which manifested itself into a love of fonts during his time at Apple Computers (Baker). He became somewhat of a hippy during this time, partaking in psychedelic drugs, eastern philosophy and a diet of only fruit (fruitarian), his short time working on an orchard, which Wozniak says was actually a commune, might have been his inspiration for the Companies name (Baker). </p>'

Though he had great ideas for the games, he did not get along well with his colleagues, whom complained not just about his attitude, but about his hygiene too. Acorn solved these problems by giving Jobs the only night shift. When the company created the new game ‘Breakout’, they offered up to a $5k bonus for anyone who could reduce the number of expensive TTL chips needed to run the game. Wozniak worked on solving this engineering problem while working at Hewlett-Packard during the day, and sneaking in Atari to work with Jobs at night. Jobs told Wozniak that he would give him half of a $700 bonus. During his time at Atari, he took a backpacking trip around India, it is said that he partook in a great deal of psychedelic drugs during this trip.	</p>'

Apple<br><br>Jobs and Wozniak “were also active in the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of computer hobbyists, where Wozniak`s homemade computer drew attention from other enthusiasts” (Metz). In 1976 Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computer from Jobs’ adoptive parents’ garage with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Wayne left soon after the company was founded (Baker). They sold the Apple I in the form of a kit for $666.66 (CNET News Staff). It didn’t come with a mouse, a keyboard or even a case, they simply had the idea to make “computers small enough for people to have in their homes or offices” (Richardson). In 1977, Acorn introduced Jobs to “venture capitalists” (Cifaldi). and Jobs Incorporated Apple. They added a case to the computer and the first ever colour graphics (Richardson) creating the Apple II. On “December 12th, 1980 Apple goes public, putting Jobs’ net worth north of $200 million (CNET News Staff). </p>'

Jobs then hired ”PepsiCo`s John Sculley to be president” (Richardson). In an effort to compete with IBM, Jobs spent a great deal on a famous “1984” commercial that played at the Superbowl, the board members, including Sculley, didn’t like how much Jobs was spending on the making of or the advertising of the Macintosh. “In 1984, Apple released the Macintosh, marketing the computer as a piece of a counterculture lifestyle: romantic, youthful, creative. But despite positive sales and performance superior to IBM`s PCs, the Macintosh was still not IBM-compatible. In fact, “a furious Jobs accused Gates and Microsoft of ripping off the Macintosh [due to the company announcing it’s first version of Windows], but Gates didn’t care – he knew that graphical interfaces would be big, and didn’t think Apple had the exclusive rights to the idea […], [b]esides, […] Apple took the idea […] from the Xerox PARC labs” (Hartman, Weinberger). Sculley Believed Jobs was hurting Apple” (Biography.com). Jobs quit from Apple on September 16th, 1985 after losing a boardroom battle for control of the company from Sculley (Kahney).</p>'
